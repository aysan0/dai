## Dai Repo 1

Hello,

We'll use this repo to code in. 

You should try doing the following:

1) Install git 
    * install homebrew here: https://brew.sh/
    * use homebrew to download git: https://git-scm.com/download/mac

2) Clone this repository to your computer 
    * documentation page: https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories

3) Create a new branch (see documentation):
    * consider using ```git checkout -b <branch_name>```

3) Write a function that takes a list of strings and prints them, one per line, in a rectangular frame. For example the list ["Hello", "World", "in", "a", "frame"] gets printed as:

<pre>
*********
* Hello *
* World *
* in    *
* a     *
* frame *
*********
</pre>

4) Write another method that reads a file that contains 5 strings per line as input and print the rectangular frames for all. <br/>
For example:

<pre>
For the provided input.txt 

the output should be

*********
* hello *
* world *
* i     *
* am    *
* can   *
*********

********
* a    *
* b    *
* c    *
* d    *
* test *
********

******
* 5e *
* __ *
* tt *
* h  *
* e  *
******

</pre>

5) Add and commit your changes (see github documentation for more info)

6) Create a pull request to the main branch (see pull requests on github documentation)
